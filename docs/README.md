## Examples

- [Multiple datasets](examples/1-data): Aggregating multiple datasets considering the ZIP code boundaries of Manhattan. We also define a parallel coordinates chart to support the exploration.
- [Shadow in Downtown Manhattan](examples/2-shadow): Visualize how shadows can have a significant impact on a highly dense region of New York City.
- [What-if scenarios](examples/3-what-if): Defining a what-if scenario in downtown Chicago. The example uses simulation data from two different scenarios to analyze the impact a few buildings can have on Millennium Park.
